# Memory Lane

Share memories with you Family and Friends !

[Add video]

This is a project made for a Technical assessment for a company. I will not say the name.

I had a lot of fun making it and still have a lot of ideas but I decided to stop it for now. I made what they asked me for. I will perhaps continue it in the future.

## Problem definition

- Deliver a first iteration
- Make a solution for Friends and Family to share memories together in a single place.
- Collection of events that happened in a chronological order
- Each event should have (at least) a Title, a Description, a Timestamp and one or more images.

## Timeframe

I made this in actually 3 days. Roughly 6 ~ 8 hours a day.  
Between learning, designing, testing, coding and having fun.

## Technical Stack 

I have seen this as a challange so I decide to use a few things I did not use in a while (and some never !)

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) v15 (Love React!) with Typescript.
- [Mantine UI library](https://mantine.dev/) (highly recommanded).
- [Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/icons) for... icons !
- [Dayjs](https://day.js.org/) for date management. Smaller than Moment and very enjoyable to use.
- [Sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) for database.
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for Form validation.
- [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/) for Global State Management.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) as a Database ORM.

## Installation

Please note that `yarn` is required.  
If you do not have it, just install it:

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

Normally, everything should be prepared already.  
Just clone, install packages and run !

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ekarious/memory-lane.git
cd memory-lane
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

## Use

Just have fun with this little `demo` app.
